# StrikingSpeed
Repository for my Master's Thesis at the University of Applied Sciences in Wr. Neustadt

This python file analyses striking velocity for strikes recorded with the PhyPhox App. To use it attach the mobile phone to the wrist or ankle and start a linear acceleration experiment. When using data from a different sensor, please prepare a .csv file as follows:

Column 0: Time Stamps in seconds
Column 1: Acceleration along local x-axis, in m/s2
Column 2: Acceleration along local y-axis, in m/s2
Column 3: Acceleration along local z-axis, in m/s2
Column 4: Absolute Acceleration as sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)

The basis for the implemented methods can be found in:
